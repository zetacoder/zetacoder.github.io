# [BACKEND WEB PORTFOLIO](https://zetacoder.github.io)

Simple [WEB PORTFOLIO](https://zetacoder.github.io) design using Javascript, Boostrap, HTML and CSS to show my GOLANG BACKEND DEVELOPER profile. It contains my experience, skills and the projects I did from scratch.  Includes a contact form that is going to be linked to a MySQL database and configurated in Golang by myself.
