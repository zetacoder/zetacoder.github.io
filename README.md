# ALBERTO GONZ√ÅLEZ - BACKEND WEB PORTFOLIO

Simple WEB PORTFOLIO design using Javascript, Boostrap, HTML and CSS to show my GOLANG BACKEND DEVELOPER profile. It contains my experience, skills and the projects I did from scratch.  Includes a contact form that is going to be linked to a MySQL database and configurated in Golang by myself.
